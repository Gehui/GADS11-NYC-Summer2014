(VGeneral relativity, or the general theory of relativity, is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1916 and the current description of gravitation in modern physics. General relativity generalizes special relativity and Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations.\u000aSome predictions of general relativity differ significantly from those of classical physics, especially concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light. Examples of such differences include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the gravitational redshift of light, and the gravitational time delay. The predictions of general relativity have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date. Although general relativity is not the only relativistic theory of gravity, it is the simplest theory that is consistent with experimental data. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.\u000aEinstein's theory has important astrophysical implications. For example, it implies the existence of black holes\u2014regions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing, not even light, can escape\u2014as an end-state for massive stars. There is ample evidence that the intense radiation emitted by certain kinds of astronomical objects is due to black holes; for example, microquasars and active galactic nuclei result from the presence of stellar black holes and black holes of a much more massive type, respectively. The bending of light by gravity can lead to the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, in which multiple images of the same distant astronomical object are visible in the sky. General relativity also predicts the existence of gravitational waves, which have since been observed indirectly; a direct measurement is the aim of projects such as LIGO and NASA/ESA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and various pulsar timing arrays. In addition, general relativity is the basis of current cosmological models of a consistently expanding universe.

a(VGeneral relativity is a theory of space and time. The theory was created by Albert Einstein in November 1915 and published in early 1916. The central idea of general relativity is that space and time are two aspects of spacetime. Spacetime is curved when there is gravity, matter, energy, and momentum. The links between these forces are shown in the Einstein Field Equations. One equation in General relativity is , and there are many more.\u000aIn general relativity, an observer in freefall and an observer standing still on a body with mass such as the Earth see no difference in the movement of an object they drop. This is known as the equivalence principle.\u000aThe Sun can be seen as this kind of valley in spacetime, and one of the other objects in the valley is the Earth. The Earth does not roll directly towards the Sun (or ball) because it is moving too fast. The force pulling the Earth towards the sun is about the same as a second force. This second force is called the centrifugal force. The centrifugal force exists because the Earth moves sideways. This sideways motion makes the distance between the Earth and Sun increase. Since the Earth is being pulled towards the sun and moving away at the same time, it stays at about the same distance. This is also how the Moon orbits the earth. In this second case, Earth is the ball and the Moon is the object.\u000aGeneral relativity has predicted many things which were later seen. These include:\u000aAs light gets closer to the sun, it bends towards the sun twice as much as classical physics (the system used before general relativity) predicts. This was seen in an experiment Arthur Eddington did in 1919. When scientists saw his experiment they started to take general relativity seriously.\u000aThe perihelion of the planet Mercury rotates along its orbit more than is expected under Newtonian physics. General relativity accounts for the difference between what is seen and what is expected without it.\u000aRedshift from gravity. When light moves away from an object with gravity (moving away from the center of the valley), it is stretched into longer wavelengths. This was confirmed by the Pound-Rebka experiment.\u000aThe Shapiro delay. Light appears to slow down when it passes close to a massive object. This was first seen in the 1960s by space probes headed towards the planet Venus.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Related pages ==\u000aSpecial theory of relativity\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other websites ==\u000aAlbert Einstein's Theory of Relativity in words of four letters or less

a(VIn probability theory and statistics, Bayes's theorem (alternatively Bayes's law or Bayes's rule) is a result that is of importance in the mathematical manipulation of conditional probabilities. Bayes's rule can be derived from more basic axioms of probability, specifically conditional probability.\u000aWhen applied, the probabilities involved in Bayes's theorem may have any of a number of probability interpretations. In one of these interpretations, the theorem is used directly as part of a particular approach to statistical inference. ln particular, with the Bayesian interpretation of probability, the theorem expresses how a subjective degree of belief should rationally change to account for evidence: this is Bayesian inference, which is fundamental to Bayesian statistics. However, Bayes's theorem has applications in a wide range of calculations involving probabilities, not just in Bayesian inference.\u000aBayes's theorem is named after Thomas Bayes (/\u02c8be\u026az/; 1701\u20131761), who first suggested using the theorem to update beliefs. His work was significantly edited and updated by Richard Price before it was posthumously read at the Royal Society. The ideas gained limited exposure until they were independently rediscovered and further developed by Laplace, who first published the modern formulation in his 1812 Théorie analytique des probabilités.\u000aSir Harold Jeffreys wrote that Bayes's theorem "is to the theory of probability what Pythagoras's theorem is to geometry".

a(VIn probability theory and applications, Bayes' theorem shows the relation between a conditional probability and its reverse form. For example, the probability of a hypothesis given some observed pieces of evidence and the probability of that evidence given the hypothesis. This theorem is after Thomas Bayes (pronounced how to say: /\u02c8be\u026az/ or "bays") and often called Bayes' law or Bayes' rule.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Formula ==\u000aThe equation used is:\u000a\u000aWhere:\u000aP(A) is the prior probability or marginal probability of A. It is "prior" in the sense that it does not take into account any information about B.\u000aP(A|B) is the conditional probability of A, given B. It is also called the posterior probability because it is derived from or depends upon the specified value of B.\u000aP(B|A) is the conditional probability of B given A. It is also called the likelihood.\u000aP(B) is the prior or marginal probability of B, and acts as a normalizing constant.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Example ==\u000aA simple example is as follows: There is a 40% chance of it raining on Sunday. If it rains on Sunday, there is a 10% chance it will rain on Monday. If it didn't rain on Sunday, there's an 80% chance it will rain on Monday.\u000a"Raining on Sunday" is event A, and "Raining on Monday" is event B.\u000aP(A) = 0.40 = Probability of Raining on Sunday.\u000aP(A`) = 0.60 = Probability of not raining on Sunday.\u000aP(B|A) = 0.10 = Probability of it raining on Monday, if it rained on Sunday.\u000aP(B`|A) = 0.90 = Probability of it not raining on Monday, if it rained on Sunday.\u000aP(B|A`) = 0.80 = Probability of it raining on Monday, if it did not rain on Sunday.\u000aP(B`|A`) = 0.20 = Probability of it not raining on Monday, if it did not rain on Sunday.\u000aThe first thing we'd normally calculate is the probability of it raining on Monday: This would be the sum of the probability of "Raining on Sunday and raining on Monday" and "Not raining on Sunday and raining on Monday"\u000a chance\u000aHowever, what if we said: "It rained on Monday. What is the probability it rained on Sunday?" That is where Bayes' theorem comes in. It allows us to calculate the probability of an earlier event, given the result of a later event.\u000aThe equation used is:\u000a\u000aIn our case, "Raining on Sunday" is event A, and "Raining on Monday" is event B.\u000aP(B|A) = 0.10 = Probability of it raining on Monday, if it rained on Sunday.\u000aP(A) = 0.40 = Probability of Raining on Sunday.\u000aP(B) = 0.52 = Probability of Raining on Monday.\u000aSo, to calculate the probability it rained on Sunday, given that it rained on Monday:\u000a\u000aor:\u000a\u000aIn other words, if it rained on Monday, there's a 7.69% chance it rained on Sunday.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Intuitive Explanation ==\u000aTo calculate the probability of it having rained on Sunday, given that it rained on Monday, we can take the following steps:\u000aWe know that it rained on Monday. Therefore, the total probability is P(B).\u000aThe probability it rained on Sunday is P(A).\u000aThe probability it rained on Monday, given that it rained on Sunday is P(B|A).\u000aThe probability of raining on Sunday AND raining Monday is P(A)*P(B|A).\u000aTherefore, the total probability of it having rained on Sunday, given that it rained on Monday, is the chance of it raining on Sunday and Monday divided by the total chance of it having rained on Monday.\u000aTherefore\u000a\u000aAnother way to see this, which shows where Bayes' theorem comes from, is to consider the probability P(AB) that it rains on both Sunday and Monday. This can be calculated in two different ways, which give the same answer for P(AB):\u000a\u000aBayes' theorem is just another way to write that equation.

a(VAugusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (10 December 1815 \u2013 27 November 1852), born Augusta Ada Byron and now commonly known as Ada Lovelace, was an English mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. Because of this, she is often described as the world's first computer programmer.\u000aLovelace was born 10 December 1815 as the only child of the poet Lord Byron and his wife Anne Isabella Byron. All Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later, eventually dying of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years old. Ada's mother remained bitter at Lord Byron and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing what she saw as the insanity seen in her father, but Ada remained interested in him despite this (and was, upon her eventual death, buried next to him at her request).\u000aAda described her approach as "poetical science" and herself as an "Analyst (& Metaphysician)". As a young adult, her mathematical talents led her to an ongoing working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, and in particular Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Between 1842 and 1843, she translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the engine, which she supplemented with an elaborate set of notes of her own, simply called Notes. These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program\u2014that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers. She also developed a vision on the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching while others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. Her mind-set of "poetical science" led her to ask basic questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.

It is native to parts of South and Southeast Asia, and is believed to have originated in the southwestern rain forests of India, in present-day Kerala,in Tamil Nadu ( in Panruti ), coastal Karnataka and Maharashtra. The jackfruit tree is well suited to tropical lowlands, and its fruit is the largest tree-borne fruit, reaching as much as 80 pounds (36 kg) in weight, 36 inches (90 cm) in length, and 20 inches (50 cm) in diameter.\u000aThe jackfruit tree is a widely cultivated and popular food item in tropical regions of India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Jackfruit is also found across Africa (e.g., in Cameroon, Uganda, Tanzania, Madagascar, and Mauritius), as well as throughout Brazil and in Caribbean nations such as Jamaica.

a(VMantis shrimp or stomatopods are marine crustaceans, the members of the order Stomatopoda. They may reach 30 centimetres (12 in) in length, though in exceptional cases have been recorded at up to 38 cm (15 in). The carapace of mantis shrimp covers only the rear part of the head and the first four segments of the thorax. There are more that 400 species of Mantis shrimp. They come in a variety of colours, from shades of brown to bright neon colours and are among the most important predators in many shallow, tropical and sub-tropical marine habitats. Despite being common, they are poorly understood as many species spend most of their life tucked away in burrows and holes.\u000aCalled "sea locusts" by ancient Assyrians, "prawn killers" in Australia and now sometimes referred to as "thumb splitters" \u2013 because of the animal's ability to inflict painful gashes if handled incautiously \u2013 mantis shrimp sport powerful claws that they use to attack and kill prey by spearing, stunning, or dismemberment. In captivity, some larger species are capable of breaking through aquarium glass with a single strike.

a(VMantis shrimps are crustacean stomatopods.\u000aThey are not actually shrimps, but members of the order Stomatopoda. There are about 400 species.\u000aThey are predators which kill their prey by hitting them at high speed.\u000aThey hold their body in a manner like that of a praying mantis, and have large, complex eyes. Some species can be 30 cm long.\u000aThey are highly coloured, and live in shallow tropical and subtropical habitats such as coral reefs.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Attack methods ==\u000aEach species has one of these two methods of attack\u000aSpearers are armed with spiny appendages topped with barbed tips, used to stab and snag prey.\u000aSmashers, on the other hand, have a club as an appendage, and a simpler spear. The spear is quite sharp and used in fights between their own kind. The club is used to bludgeon and smash their prey.\u000aBoth types strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey, and can cause serious damage on victims larger than themselves.\u000aIn smashers, these two weapons are employed with blinding quickness, and hit their prey with the speed of a bullet. This is one of the fastest responses known to man.\u000aSmashers use this ability to attack snails, crabs, molluscs and rock oysters; their blunt clubs enabling them to crack the shells of their prey into pieces. Spearers, on the other hand, prefer the meat of softer animals, like fish, which their barbed claws can more easily slice and snag.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Cavitation shock waves ===\u000aBecause they strike so rapidly, they generate cavitation bubbles between the appendage and the striking surface. The collapse of these bubbles hits their prey in addition to the impact of the appendage against the striking surface.\u000aThis means that the prey is hit twice by a single strike; first by the claw and then by the collapsing cavitation bubbles that immediately follow. Even if the initial strike misses the prey, the resulting shock wave can be enough to kill or stun the prey.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Eyesight ==\u000aTheir eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about independently of each other. They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom.\u000aThe mantis shrimp has such good eyes it can perceive both polarized light, and colour vision outside the normal visual spectrum.\u000aSome species have at least 16 different photoreceptor types, 12 of them for colour analysis in the different wavelengths (including four which are sensitive to ultraviolet light) and four of them for analysing polarised light. By comparison, humans have only four visual pigments, three dedicated to see colour.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Function of eyesight ===\u000aThe eyes of mantis shrimp may recognize different types of coral, prey species (which are often transparent or semi-transparent), or predators, such as barracuda, which have shimmering scales.\u000aAlso, the manner in which mantis shrimp hunt (very rapid movements of the claws) may require very accurate ranging information, which would require accurate depth perception.\u000aDuring mating rituals, mantis shrimp actively fluoresce, and the wavelength of this fluorescence matches the wavelengths detected by their eye pigments.\u000aFemales are only fertile during certain phases of the tidal cycle; the ability to perceive the phase of the moon may therefore help prevent wasted mating efforts. It may also give mantis shrimp information about the size of the tide, which is important for species living in shallow water near the shore.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

a(VDer Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung), WWV 86, is a cycle of four epic operas by the German composer Richard Wagner (1813\u20131883). The works are based loosely on characters from the Norse sagas and the Nibelungenlied. The composer termed the cycle a "Bühnenfestspiel" (stage festival play), structured in three days preceded by a Vorabend ("ante-evening"). It is often referred to as the Ring Cycle, Wagner's Ring, or simply the Ring.\u000aWagner wrote the libretto and music over the course of about twenty-six years, from 1848 to 1874. The four operas that constitute the Ring cycle are, in sequence:\u000aDas Rheingold (The Rhine Gold)\u000aDie Walküre (The Valkyrie)\u000aSiegfried\u000aGötterdämmerung (Twilight of the Gods)\u000aAlthough individual operas of the sequence are sometimes performed separately, Wagner intended them to be performed in series. The first performance as a cycle opened the first Bayreuth Festival in 1876, beginning with Das Rheingold on 13 August and ending with Götterdämmerung on 17 August.

a(VDer Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung (Alberich)) is a cycle of four operas by Richard Wagner.\u000aThe first opera in the cycle is Das Rheingold.\u000aThe second opera in the cycle is Die Walküre.\u000aThe third opera in the cycle is Siegfried.\u000aThe fourth opera in the cycle is Götterdämmerung.\u000aThe story of each opera can be found in the separate articles.\u000aSometimes it is known as a \u201ctetralogy\u201d meaning: four works that belong together.\u000aWagner took the story of the operas from a book called the Nibelungenlied (the Nibelung Song) which was written in the 12th century by a German poet. We do not know the name of the poet. The story is about the ancient gods from German mythology.\u000aWagner made a lot of changes to the story in order to make it suitable for his four operas. Wagner\u2019s story tells of a hoard of gold which is being guarded by the Rhinemaidens. The dwarf Alberich steals the gold and uses some of it to make a ring which makes the owner powerful over all the world. When Wotan, the chief god, steals it from him, Alberich puts a curse on the ring. The ring will bring death to whoever has it. The ring goes through the hands of several characters, all of whom die in the end.\u000aAlberich belongs to a race of dwarfs called the \u201cNibelungs\u201d. The word \u201cNibelungen\u201d in the title of the cycle: Der Ring des Nibelungen (\u201cThe Ring of the Nibelung\u201d), refers to Alberich (it is singular, not plural).\u000aThe story of Wagner\u2019s Ring cycle sounds quite fantastic and strange, like a fairy tale. Although the characters seems very different from real people, the story tells us all about basic human emotions. It is a story about greed, love, lust, intrigue etc. This is what makes it so powerful.\u000aWagner\u2019s music matches each character and situation beautifully. It develops continuously: there are no breaks in the music during the acts. Wagner used what he called leitmotifs (leading motives). These are tunes or chords or little musical phrases which are linked to particular people in the opera. In this way he can hint at things very cleverly in the music. For example: there is a leitmotiv for the curse. Whenever we hear this curse motive we know that the curse of the ring is working.\u000aWagner spent about twenty years writing the Ring cycle. He started in the 1850s when he was living in Switzerland. He wrote all the libretto (the words) himself, as he always did for his operas. By 1857 he had finished the first two operas and two thirds of Siegfried. It was many years later that he finally finished Siegfried and wrote the final opera as well.\u000aWagner wanted to have the Ring cycle performed in a special opera house which would be built in the way he wanted. He needed a lot of money for his ideas, and he was very lucky to find someone who adored his music and was happy to give him a lot of money. This was King Ludwig II of Bavaria (sometimes called the \u201cmad king of Bavaria\u201d because he did become insane). Wagner told the King that the Ring cycle would be performed in Munich which was the capital city of Bavaria. Later, when it seemed impossible to build a new opera house there, Wagner broke his promise and built his opera house in Bayreuth instead. The King did not seem to mind and still gave him lots of money for the project as well as a nice house to live in. Das Rheingold was first performed in Munich in 1869 and Die Walküre in 1870. The whole Ring cycle was first performed in 1876 in the new opera house called the Festspielhaus in Bayreuth.

a(VThe Antikythera mechanism is an mechanical calculator. It is also described as the first mechanical computer. It was discovered in 1901 in a shipwreck off the coast of Antikythera, Greece. A number of gears worked together, much like they do in a mechanical clock. Using a model, it was found that the device could be use to show the motions of the sun, the moon and probably some of the planets. This makes it possible to use the device as a calendar. There were three big dials, and three small ones. Used as a calendar the main functions were:\u000aA solar calendar showing days and months, as well as the babylonian zodiac\u000aA Lunisolar calendar showing the months\u000aA calendar, showing Eclipse cycles, of past and future eclipses of the sun and the moon\u000aA calendar, showing the years in which there would be panhelllenic games (or Olympics)\u000aThe device was found on a shipwreck, near the island Antikythera, between the Peloponnese and Crete. Different coins were also found on the wreck. There are coins from Pergamon, dating between 86BC and 67 BC, and coins from Ephesus, dating between 70 BC and 60 BC. This means that the ship sunk between 70 and 60 BC. This device is the most complex device known in Antiquity. Only in the 14th century did people have the knowledge to build similar devices.\u000aThe device is now on display in the Bronze Collection of the National Archaeological Museum of Athens.\u000aWhen the mechanism was found, it consisted of corroded metal plates. Before x-rays could be used to show what was "inside", it was very difficult to judge what the mechanism did. Many of the parts that make up the mechanism were lost either during the roughly 2000 years it had laid on the sea floor, or shortly after discovery. Many gears have not "survived" in one piece. None of the scales is complete, and only one indicator survived as a fragment. The Antikythera Research project has produced a reconstruction; it added seven gears that were probably part of the device. There are 35 gears, and seven displays. There are many hints that the device was also used to calculate and show the movement of stars, even though none of the necessary gears or displays have been found.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Mechanism of operation ==\u000a\u000aThere were 82 parts in total. With the parts found it is not possible to get the mechanism with all displays and dials fully operational. It is also not possible to know how many parts have been lost. In total, 30 gears were found. One gear is probably part of a planetary display, that has been lost. To make the reconstructed displays work, another eight gears would be necessary, but they have been lost. There are two crown gears, ll the other gears found are normal gears (that require a special alignment of the axes). The gear was a primitive one, and the transmission was not uniform. The mechanism was repaired at least once, which shows that it must have been used often.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other websites ==\u000aThe Antikythera Mechanism Research Project

a(VPolytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene that has numerous applications. The best known brand name of PTFE-based formulas is Teflon by DuPont Co., who discovered the compound.\u000aPTFE is a fluorocarbon solid, as it is a high-molecular-weight compound consisting wholly of carbon and fluorine. PTFE is hydrophobic: neither water nor water-containing substances wet PTFE, as fluorocarbons demonstrate mitigated London dispersion forces due to the high electronegativity of fluorine. PTFE has one of the lowest coefficients of friction against any solid.\u000aPTFE is used as a non-stick coating for pans and other cookware. It is very non-reactive, partly because of the strength of carbon\u2013fluorine bonds and so it is often used in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive chemicals. Where used as a lubricant, PTFE reduces friction, wear and energy consumption of machinery. It is also commonly used as a graft material in surgical interventions.

It was discovered by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes on April 8, 1911 in Leiden. Like ferromagnetism and atomic spectral lines, superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon. It is characterized by the Meissner effect, the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor as it transitions into the superconducting state. The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of perfect conductivity in classical physics.\u000aThe electrical resistivity of a metallic conductor decreases gradually as temperature is lowered. In ordinary conductors, such as copper or silver, this decrease is limited by impurities and other defects. Even near absolute zero, a real sample of a normal conductor shows some resistance. In a superconductor, the resistance drops abruptly to zero when the material is cooled below its critical temperature. An electric current flowing through a loop of superconducting wire can persist indefinitely with no power source.\u000aIn 1986, it was discovered that some cuprate-perovskite ceramic materials have a critical temperature above 90 K (\u2212183 °C). Such a high transition temperature is theoretically impossible for a conventional superconductor, leading the materials to be termed high-temperature superconductors. Liquid nitrogen boils at 77 K, and superconduction at higher temperatures than this facilitates many experiments and applications that are less practical at lower temperatures.

a(VA superconductor is a special type of material that conducts electricity without resistance. That means that electrons (tiny particles with negative charge) can flow very easily through the material. This can be achieved only at very low temperatures. The critical temperature at which a material becomes superconducting varies from material to material. Most materials are not superconductors.\u000aAnother property of superconductors is the Flux Trapping Effect, which can cause a rare earth magnet to float above a cooled superconductor.

a(VThe durian (/\u02c8dj\u028ari\u0259n/) is the fruit of several tree species belonging to the genus Durio. There are 30 recognised Durio species, at least nine of which produce edible fruit. Durio zibethinus is the only species available in the international market: other species are sold in their local regions.\u000aRegarded by many people in southeast Asia as the "king of fruits", the durian is distinctive for its large size, strong odour, and formidable thorn-covered husk. The fruit can grow as large as 30 centimetres (12 in) long and 15 centimetres (6 in) in diameter, and it typically weighs one to three kilograms (2 to 7 lb). Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale yellow to red, depending on the species.\u000aThe edible flesh emits a distinctive odour that is strong and penetrating even when the husk is intact. Some people regard the durian as having a pleasantly sweet fragrance; others find the aroma overpowering and revolting. The smell evokes reactions from deep appreciation to intense disgust, and has been described variously as rotten onions, turpentine, and raw sewage. The persistence of its odour has led to the fruit's banishment from certain hotels and public transportation in Southeast Asia.\u000aThe durian, native to Southeast Asia, has been known to the Western world for about 600 years. The nineteenth-century British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace famously described its flesh as "a rich custard highly flavoured with almonds". The flesh can be consumed at various stages of ripeness, and it is used to flavour a wide variety of savoury and sweet edibles in Southeast Asian cuisines. The seeds can also be eaten when cooked.\u000aThere are hundreds of durian cultivars; many consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.

Nevertheless, he received accolades and state awards and served in the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR (1947\u20131962) and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (from 1962 until his death).\u000aAfter a period influenced by Sergei Prokofiev and Igor Stravinsky, Shostakovich developed a hybrid style, as exemplified by Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (1934). This single work juxtaposed a wide variety of trends, including the neo-classical style (showing the influence of Stravinsky) and post-Romanticism (after Gustav Mahler). Sharp contrasts and elements of the grotesque characterize much of his music.\u000aShostakovich's orchestral works include 15 symphonies and six concerti. His chamber output includes 15 string quartets, a piano quintet, two piano trios, and two pieces for string octet. His piano works include two solo sonatas, an early set of preludes, and a later set of 24 preludes and fugues. Other works include three operas, several song cycles, ballets, and a substantial quantity of film music; especially well known is The Second Waltz, Op. 99, music to the film The First Echelon (1955\u20131956).\u000a\u000a

a(VDmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich (born St Petersburg, September 25 1906; died Moscow August 9 1975) was a Russian-Soviet composer.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Shostakovich's life ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Early years ===\u000aShostakovich\u2019s parents came from Siberia. His father was a biologist and engineer, and his mother was a pianist. They lived comfortably, although this was to change after the Revolution (1917). Shostakovich studied the piano and composition at the Petrograd Conservatory (St. Petersburg was called Petrograd between 1914 and 1924, after which it became Leningrad until 1991, when it became St. Petersburg again). After his mother died,the family were short of money, so young Dmitri had to earn money by playing the piano in cinemas for silent movies. He worked extremely hard and with a lot of concentration. He was very successful both as a pianist and a composer. His Symphony No. 1 was very popular. His music sounded very modern with lots of dissonant chords. His first dramatic works include an opera called The Nose and a ballet called The Golden Age.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Maturity ===\u000aIn 1930 he wrote an important opera called Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District. It was a huge success, and the critics said that \u201cit could only have been written by a Soviet composer brought up in the best traditions of Soviet culture\u201d. One night in 1936 Stalin came to watch it. He left before the end. Two days later there was an article in the official government paper Pravda. The title was \u201cChaos instead of Music\u201d. It said that this opera was primitive and vulgar, full of screaming and noise. The politicians were criticizing not just Shostakovich but all modern Soviet music. Shostakovich was denounced, and his friends were too frightened to defend him in case they were denounced as well. Shostakovich suffered quietly and wrote his Fifth Symphony. The politicians liked this symphony. He was once more thought of as the leading Soviet composer. He was supposed to have said that his new symphony was the \u201ccreative reply of a Soviet artist to justified criticism\u201d, but it was actually a critic who said this. Shortly afterward, he received the Stalin Prize for his Piano Quintet.\u000aDuring World War II Shostakovich was evacuated with his wife and two children. His next two symphonies, nos. 7 and 8, describe the war. They were hugely popular in the West. In the United States, the Seventh Symphony became the symbol of resistance against Nazism.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== After World War II ===\u000aAfter the war, Soviet politicians again began to control and criticize artistic life very hard. In 1948, there was a big meeting at which Shostakovich, Prokofiev, and several other composers were criticized. Their music was called \u201cformalist\u201d, \u201canti-democratic\u201d, and lots of other things which had nothing to do with music. There was nothing the composers could do except to say how sorry they were. For the next five years Shostakovich was careful not to write anything the politicians would not like. He wrote songs such as "The Sun Shines on our Motherland". Some of his other compositions in which he expressed his real feelings were kept in a drawer so that no one could see them.\u000aIn 1953, Stalin died and things became easier again. Shostakovich wrote his Tenth Symphony. The whole world now saw Shostakovich as the greatest Soviet composer. He suffered less from official repression. Surprisingly, articles criticizing the music of modern young composers carried his name, but a lot of these articles he had not written. He was persuaded to sign them so that the politicians would leave him in peace. He wrote more symphonies and quartets as well as concertos. His opera Lady Macbeth was revised and given a different title: Katerina Izmaylova. It was performed in many countries, and was made into a movie. Yet in 1962, he wrote his very serious Symphony No. 13 using poems including one of the Babi Yar massacre, so he suffered from repression again.\u000aIn his later years, Shostakovich suffered from ill-health. He had poliomyelitis, which made it difficult for him to use his hands and legs. He suffered several heart attacks, and started to lose his sight. He died of lung cancer in 1975.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Shostakovich\u2019s music ==\u000aShostakovich is best known for his fifteen symphonies and fifteen string quartets. His most important opera is Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District. He also wrote a lot of film music and music for plays including Hamlet. Shostakovich read a lot of Russian literature. His songs had words by famous Russian writers such as Alexander Pushkin, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Alexander Blok. He wrote twenty-four Preludes and Fugues for piano, a piano trio, two piano concertos, a piano quintet, a sonata for cello and piano, and a sonata for viola and piano (his last work).\u000aHe had lots of friends who regularly gave the first performances of his works. Most of his symphonies were first performed by the Leningrad Philharmonic conducted by Eugeny Mravinsky. His string quartets were first performed by the Beethoven String Quartet. The violinist David Oistrakh, the cellist Mstislav Rostropovitch, and the pianist Sviatoslav Richter were all close friends who played his music.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Shostakovich the pianist ==\u000aShostakovich had an amazing musical memory and could play almost anything he knew by ear. When he was young he spent hours improvising, composing, and playing. Although he had small hands, he was a very gifted pianist. He had no difficulty in playing any of his works on the piano, even music written for an orchestra. He often played his music too fast and without much expression.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Shostakovich\u2019s personality ==\u000aShostakovich was a very nervous person. He was shy and very self-critical. He hated having to talk to people he did not know. He did not sit still, always fidgeting and twitching his face nervously. He was, however, always very polite and very kind to everyone he met. He was very careful not to criticize musicians who asked him for advice. He said very little, but what he said was carefully thought out. He wrote lots of letters to the authorities to try to help his friends. He was very reliable, and always tried to arrive on time. In his last years, he found it very difficult to use his hands because of his illness, but he always insisted on writing down his music himself.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aThe New Grove Dictionary of Music & Musicians edited by Stanley Sadie (1980) ISBN 1-56159-174-2\u000aShostakovich: A life Remembered by Elizabeth Wilson (1994) ISBN 0-571-17486-8

a(VSteel is an alloy of iron and carbon that is widely used in construction and other applications because of its hardness and tensile strength. Carbon, other elements, and inclusions within iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that naturally exist in the iron atom crystal lattices. The carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2.1% of its weight. Varying the amount of alloying elements, their form in the steel either as solute elements, or as precipitated phases, retards the movement of those dislocations that make iron so ductile and weak, and thus controls qualities such as the hardness, ductility, and tensile strength of the resulting steel. Steel's strength compared to pure iron is only possible at the expense of ductility, of which iron has an excess.\u000aAlthough steel had been produced in bloomery furnaces for thousands of years, steel's use expanded extensively after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century for blister steel and then crucible steel. With the invention of the Bessemer process in the mid-19th century, a new era of mass-produced steel began. This was followed by Siemens-Martin process and then Gilchrist-Thomas process that refined the quality of steel. With their introductions, mild steel replaced wrought iron.\u000aFurther refinements in the process, such as basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS), further lowered the cost of production, while increasing the quality of the metal and largely replaced earlier methods. Today, steel is one of the most common materials in the world, with more than 1.3 billion tons produced annually. It is a major component in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, automobiles, machines, appliances, and weapons. Modern steel is generally identified by various grades defined by assorted standards organizations.

a(VSteel is a mixture of several metals (this is called an alloy) but most of it is iron. Steel is harder and stronger than iron. Steels are often iron alloys with between 0.02% and 1.7% percent carbon by weight. Alloys with more carbon than this are known as cast iron. Steel is different from wrought iron, that has little or no carbon. There are some newer steels in which carbon is replaced with other alloying materials.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Making steel ==\u000aSteel has a long history. People in India and Sri Lanka were making small amounts of steel more than 1,500 years ago. It was very expensive and was often used to make swords and knives. In the Middle Ages, steel could be made only in small amounts since the processes took a long time.\u000aIn the time since, there have been many changes to the way steel is made. In about the year 1610 steel started to be made in England, and the way it was made got better and cheaper over the next 100 years. Cheap steel helped start the Industrial Revolution in England and in Europe. The first industrial process for making cheap steel was the Bessemer process, followed by Siemens-Martin open-hearth process. Today the most common way of making steel is the basic-oxygen steelmaking. It uses a large turnip-shaped vessel called converter. Liquid raw iron called "pig iron" is poured in and some scrap metal is added in to balance the heat. Oxygen is then blown into the iron. The oxygen burns off the extra carbon and other impurities. Then enough carbon is added to make the carbon contents as wanted. The liquid steel is then poured. It can be either cast into molds or rolled into sheets, slabs, beams and other so-called "long products", such as railway tracks.\u000aToday steel is made in huge buildings called steel mills, and is most often made by machines. It is a very cheap metal today and is used to make many things. Steel is used to making buildings and bridges, and all kinds of machines. Almost all ships and cars are today made from steel. When a steel object is old, or it is broken beyond repair, it is called scrap. The scrap can be melted down and re-shaped into a new object. Steel is recyclable material; that is, the same steel can be used and re-used.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Iron and steel chemistry ==\u000aSteel is a metal alloy which includes iron and often some carbon.\u000aEvery material is made up of atoms which are very small parts. Some atoms hold together quite well, which is what makes some solid materials hard. Something made of pure iron is softer than steel because the atoms can slip over one another. If other atoms like carbon are added, they are different from iron atoms and stop the iron atoms from sliding apart so easily. This makes the metal stronger and harder.\u000aChanging the amount of carbon (or other atoms) added to steel will change those things that are interesting and useful about the metal. These are called the properties of the steel. Some properties are:\u000aHow hard it is,\u000aHow easily it bends,\u000aIf it can be made into thin wires,\u000aIts strength,\u000aIf it is magnetic and can be picked up using a magnet,\u000aIf it will rust (or corrode)\u000aSteel with more carbon is harder and stronger than pure iron, but it also breaks more easily (brittle).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Types of steel ==\u000aThese are a few of the many types of steel:\u000aCarbon steel - the most common type, but it must be painted or covered or it will rust\u000aStainless steel - which will usually not rust much, the "stain" in the name is the red colour of rust\u000aGalvanized steel - which is steel covered with zinc, to prevent rust\u000a\u000a\u000a== Uses of steel ==\u000aThere are a huge number of things that people make from steel. It is one of the most common and useful metals. A lot of items made from iron in the past are now made of steel. Some of them are:\u000aTools\u000aMachines\u000aMotors and engines\u000aWiress]] for trains\u000aGirders for making buildings\u000aBridges\u000a[[Rail tracks|Rail\u000aBars for making reinforced concrete for buildings and bridges\u000aHulls of ships and large boats\u000aCar and train bodies\u000aMajor appliances\u000aCutlery and knives\u000aRulers\u000aRoofs\u000aAirplanes are not made from steel but from aluminium.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other websites ==

a(VA database is an organized collection of data. The data are typically organized to model relevant aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring this information. For example, modelling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies.\u000aDatabase management systems (DBMSs) are specially designed software applications that interact with the user, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general-purpose DBMS is a software system designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases. Well-known DBMSs include MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, SAP HANA, dBASE, FoxPro, IBM DB2, LibreOffice Base, FileMaker Pro, Microsoft Access and InterSystems Caché. A database is not generally portable across different DBMSs, but different DBMSs can interoperate by using standards such as SQL and ODBC or JDBC to allow a single application to work with more than one database. There are different types of database, some of them are as follows: Operational Database Specific Database External Database Hypermedia Database

a(VA database is a system for storing and taking care of data (any kind of information).\u000aA database engine can sort, change or serve the information on the database. The information itself can be stored in many different ways - before digital computers, card files, printed books and other methods were used. Now most data is kept on computer files.\u000aA database system is a computer program for managing electronic databases. A very simple example of a database system would be an electronic address book.\u000aThe data in a database is organized in some way. Before there were computers, employee data was often kept in file cabinets. There was usually one card for each employee. On the card, information such as the date of birth or the name of the employee could be found. A database also has such "cards". To the user, the card will look the same as it did in old times, only this time it will be on the screen. To the computer, the information on the card can be stored in different ways. Each of these ways is known as a database model. The most commonly used database model is called relational database model; it uses relations and sets to store the data. Normal users talking about the database model will not talk about relations, they will talk about database tables.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Uses for Database Systems ==\u000aUses for database systems include:\u000aThey store data\u000aThey store special information used to manage the data. This information is called metadata and it is not shown to all the people looking at the data.\u000aThey can solve cases where many users want to access (and possibly change) the same entries of data.\u000aThey manage access rights (who is allowed to see the data, who can change it)\u000aWhen there are many users asking questions to the database, the questions must be answered faster. So, the last person to ask a question, can get an answer in reasonable time.\u000aCertain attributes are more important than others, they can be used to find other data. This is called indexing. An index contains all the important data and can be used to find the other data.\u000aThey ensure that the data always has context (makes sense). There are a lot of different rules that can be added to tell the database system if the data makes sense. One of the rules might say November has 30 days. This means if someone wants to enter November 31 as a date, this change will be rejected.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Changing data ==\u000aIn databases, some data changes occasionally. There may be problems when data is changed, an error might have occurred. The error might make the data useless. The database system looks at the data, it must fulfill certain requirements. It does this by using a transaction. There are two points in time in the database, the time before the data was changed, and the time after the data was changed. If something goes wrong when changing the data, the database system simply puts the database back into the state before the change happened. This is called rollback. After all the changes are done successfully, they are committed. This means that the data makes sense again; committed changes can no longer be undone\u000aIn order to be able to do this, databases follow the ACID principle:\u000aAll. Either all tasks of a given set (called transaction) are done, or none of them is. Known as Atomicity\u000aComplete. The data in the database always makes sense. There is no half-done (invalid) data. Known as Consistency\u000aIndependent. If many people work on the same data, they will not see (or impact) each other. Each of them has their own view of the database, which is independent of the others. Known as Isolation\u000aDone. Transactions must be committed, when they are done. Once the committed, they can not be undone. Known as Durability.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Database model ==\u000aThere are different ways how to represent the data.\u000aSimple files (called flat files): This is the most simple form of Database system. All the data is stored in a file in plain text . Every piece of information can be seperated by a new line or a comma etc.\u000aHierarchical model: The data is organized like a tree structure. The interesting data is at the leaves of the tree. The relationships among the data entries is such that some entries are directly dependent to other entries.\u000aNetwork model: Use records and sets to store the data. Similar to Hierarchical model, but this has much more complex structure.\u000aRelational model: This uses set theory and predicate logic. It is widely used. Data looks like it is organized in tables. These tables can then be joined together so that simple queries can be chosen from them.\u000aObject oriented model: The data is represented in the form of objects as used in Object Oriented Programming. They can interact directly with the OOP language being used, as both of them have the same representation of the data internally.\u000aObject relational model: This is a hybrid of Object oriented model and relational model.\u000aNoSQL model: This is a new kind of database model and is increasing being used in the industry in big data and real-time web applications.. The data in this model is stored as key-value pairs without any strict hierarchy as in other models. NoSQL systems are also referred to as "Not only SQL" because they do not allow Structured Query Language-like query languages to be used.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Ways to organize the data ==\u000aLike in real life, the same data can be looked at from different perspectives, and it can be organized in different ways. There are different things to consider, when organizing the data:\u000aEach item of data should be stored as few times as possible. Imagine that an unmarried woman is listed in the county records, State Motor Vehicle Dept, Federal Social Security Dept and International Passport Dept. If she marries, and decides to change her name, all the these departments have to be notified. If all the departments were linked, and her name stored in only one place, then updating is easy.\u000aIf the data is stored in several different databases, it may contradict itself.\u000aThis problem makes finding data slower. If there is a lot of data, this problem of storing one piece of data in many places, will take up a lot of space. In our example there were 4 databases for one person. That will be 8 changes made, if a second person has exactly the same problem.\u000aIf you have this problem, a method called Database Normalisation was developed to solve it. Currently there are 5 Normal forms. These are ways to make a database faster, and make the data take less space.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

a(VA transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify and switch electronic signals and electrical power. It is composed of semiconductor material with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit. A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals changes the current through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal. Today, some transistors are packaged individually, but many more are found embedded in integrated circuits.\u000aThe transistor is the fundamental building block of modern electronic devices, and is ubiquitous in modern electronic systems. Following its development in 1947 by American physicists John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley, the transistor revolutionized the field of electronics, and paved the way for smaller and cheaper radios, calculators, and computers, among other things. The transistor is on the list of IEEE milestones in electronics, and the inventors were jointly awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for their achievement.

a(VA transistor is an electronic component that can be used as an amplifier, or as a switch. They are found in most electronic devices.\u000aA transistor has three connectors or terminals. In the older bipolar transistor they are the collector, the emitter, and the base. The flow of charge goes in the collector, and out of the emitter, depending on the charge flowing to the base. In this way, it is possible for the base to switch on or off the flow through the transistor. A MOSFET names its terminals differently because it works differently.\u000aThe transistor can be used for a variety of different things including amplifiers and digital switches for computer microprocessors. Digital work mostly uses MOSFETs. Some transistors are individually packaged, mainly so they can handle high power. Most are inside integrated circuits.\u000a\u000a\u000a== How they work ==\u000a\u000aTransistors have three parts, the gate, the drain, and the source  (also, the wires can be called the emitter, the collector, and the base). When the source is connected to the negative terminal of the battery, and the drain to the positive terminal, no electricity will flow in the circuit (assuming you have only a lamp in series with the transistor). But when you touch the gate with the drain, electricity will flow. This is because when the gate is positively charged, the positive electrons will push other positive electrons in the transistor letting the negative electrons flow through. The transistor can also work when the gate is just positively charged, so it doesn't need to be touching the drain.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Visualization ===\u000aAn easy way to think of how a transistor works is as a hose, the water is the electrons, and when you positively charge the gate, it unwraps the hose, letting water flow.\u000aThe basic Darlington transistor circuit is formed by taking the emitter of the input transistor and connecting it such that its emitter drives the base of the second and then connecting both collectors together\u000a\u000a\u000a== Different Uses ==\u000aTransistors can be used as a switch or as an amplifier.\u000aWhen you positively charge the gate, electricity will flow through, this is useful for electronics that require a switch to be turned on, making it an electronic switch. This rivals the mechanical switch, which requires a constant force pressing on it.\u000aAs an amplifier, transistors take the flow of the drain and source, and since the source current is so much larger than the drain's current, it is common for the drain's current to rise to the value of the source's, amplifying it.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Materials ==\u000aTransistors are made of semiconductor chemical elements, including those in Group IV in the periodic table of elements. However, Silicon, though not part of the fourth group, is widely used as well. Some elements in the fourth group are not used as much as others, for example Germanium is not a very popular material for transistors (although it is used in specialized transistors).\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aThe transistor was not the first three terminal device. The triode served the same purpose of the transistor 50 years earlier. Vacuum tubes were important in household technology. Unfortunately, tubes were big and breakable and used far too much energy which shortened the life of the tube. The transistor was invented to solve these problems. \u000aThree physicists were credited with the creation of the transistor in 1948: Walter H. Brattain, John Bardeen, and William Shockley who contributed the most.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Importance ==\u000aThe transistor is an important component today. If not for the transistor, devices such as cell phones and computers, would be very different, or they might have not been invented.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Types ==\u000aDepending on their material and the process that is used to make them there are different types of transistors. For example FETs (Field Effect Transistors), IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors) etc.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Gallery ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other websites ==\u000aAudioUK's Milestones.

a(VJohann Wolfgang von Goethe (German: [\u02c8jo\u02d0han \u02c8v\u0254lf\u0261a\u014b f\u0254n \u02c8\u0261ø\u02d0t\u0259] ( ), 28 August 1749 \u2013 22 March 1832) was a German writer and statesman. His body of work includes epic and lyric poetry written in a variety of metres and styles; prose and verse dramas; memoirs; an autobiography; literary and aesthetic criticism; treatises on botany, anatomy, and colour; and four novels. In addition, numerous literary and scientific fragments, more than 10,000 letters, and nearly 3,000 drawings by him are extant.\u000aA literary celebrity by the age of 25, Goethe was ennobled by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Carl August in 1782 after first taking up residence there in November 1775 following the success of his first novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther. He was an early participant in the Sturm und Drang literary movement. During his first ten years in Weimar, Goethe served as a member of the Duke's privy council, sat on the war and highway commissions, oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby Ilmenau, and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the University of Jena. He also contributed to the planning of Weimar's botanical park and the rebuilding of its Ducal Palace, which in 1998 were together designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\u000aAfter returning from a tour of Italy in 1788, his first major scientific work, the Metamorphosis of Plants, was published. In 1791 he was made managing director of the theatre at Weimar, and in 1794 he began a friendship with the dramatist, historian, and philosopher Friedrich Schiller, whose plays he premiered until Schiller's death in 1805. During this period Goethe published his second novel, Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, the verse epic Hermann and Dorothea, and, in 1808, the first part of his most celebrated drama, Faust. His conversations and various common undertakings throughout the 1790s with Schiller, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Johann Gottfried Herder, Alexander von Humboldt, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and August and Friedrich Schlegel have, in later years, been collectively termed Weimar Classicism.\u000aArthur Schopenhauer cited Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship as one of the four greatest novels ever written and Ralph Waldo Emerson selected Goethe as one of six "representative men" in his work of the same name, along with Plato, Napoleon, and William Shakespeare. Goethe's comments and observations form the basis of several biographical works, most notably Johann Peter Eckermann's Conversations with Goethe. There are frequent references to Goethe's writings throughout the works of G. W. F. Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann, Sigmund Freud, and Carl Jung. Goethe's poems were set to music throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by a number of composers, including Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Charles Gounod, Richard Wagner, Hugo Wolf, and Gustav Mahler.

a(VJohann Wolfgang von Goethe (August 28, 1749 \u2013 March 22, 1832) was a German writer, poet, novelist, and playwright. He also worked as an actor, administrator, scientist, geologist, botanist and philosopher. He influenced many 19th century writers and thinkers. His contributions to science include his work in botany and his Theory of Colours. Famous lines from his books are often quoted, and some of his phrases have become part of the German language. His poems were set to music by composers like Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, Wolf, and Strauss. Most of his scientific work now seems old-fashioned.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Early life ==\u000aGoethe was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. His father was well-educated and very strict. His mother was only eighteen when he was born. When Goethe was a young boy, he began to write stories and plays for his friends. In his youth, he learned Greek, Latin and French. He studied law in Leipzig from 1765 to 1768. He also wrote some letters that are seen as beautiful, and that showed his promise as a writer. He continued his studies in Strasbourg from 1770 to 1771. He joined other young men who wanted to change the way that Germans were writing. He thought that people like Johann Christoph Gottsched were too strict about writing poetry. Instead of the ideas of the Enlightenment, he wanted poets to be creative and make their own rules.\u000aOne man who had many new ideas was a poet named Johann Gottfried von Herder. Herder liked the plays of Shakespeare (which he had learned in German) as well as folk poetry. These ideas were exciting for Goethe, and he helped Herder to collect folk poetry. Both men believed that poetry should always come from the heart, and that it should be based on the poet\u2019s experiences instead of on an old-fashioned idea of what a good poem should be. Some of Goethe's best known poems were written during this time, like Heidenröslein, Der König in Thule, and Erlkönig.\u000aGoethe fell in love with several women during his lifetime. During the early period of his life, he was in love with a girl named Friederike Brion, the daughter of a pastor. Several of his poems are inspired by her. He felt extremely sad when they split up. The feeling of desertion by a lover is found in a lot of Goethe\u2019s works. They are all based on his own experience. His disappointment in love inspired him when writing about Werther in Die Leiden des jungen Werthers and Gretchen in his great play Faust. His poems also show his ideas about science and philosophy.\u000aDie Leiden des jungen Werthers (The Sufferings of Young Werther) is a book written in the form of letters. Werther is a young man who falls passionately in love with a girl called Lotte who is married to someone else. Werther kills himself in the end. The book was very successful all over Europe. People talked about \u201cWerther fever.\u201d Many young men who were disappointed in love copied Werther and killed themselves.\u000aGoethe\u2019s most famous work is a very long play called Faust. He spent most of his life working at it. He was writing the first version of Faust at this time. Based on a legendary character, it tells of a man called Faust who is tired of studying and wants to have the greatest possible happiness. The devil (called Mephistopheles in the play) tells Faust he can help him to do this, but that in the end Faust must give him his soul and go with him to hell. Faust uses magic in the hope that it will tell him everything about life.\u000aAlong with writing, Goethe was developing a career in law. In 1772, he spent four months in Wetzlar at the Imperial Law Courts. Here he made new friends, including a young girl who was already engaged to someone else.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Middle Period: Arrival in Weimar until death of Schiller (1775-1805) ==\u000aGoethe had been well-educated and was good at organizing and getting on with important people. For eleven years he worked at the court of Weimar for a young Duke called Karl August. He became a member and later the president of the Duke\u2019s cabinet. He had to organize road-building projects, and look after parks and buildings. He studied geology, mineralogy, botany and anatomy. He fell in love with a woman called Charlotte von Stein who was married and had several children. He wrote love letters to her, and she inspired him to write many poems. At this time he felt that a man\u2019s task in life was to be useful. The heroes of his books at this time were often ordinary people instead of geniuses.\u000aAfter a time he realized that all his work on governmental duties were not giving him time for his writing, so he went to Italy for 18 months. He loved the landscape and made lots of sketches, and he read the ancient poets and books on the history of art. He wrote a play in rhyme called Iphigenie auf Tauris which combines the beauty of Classicism with great poetry.\u000aWhen he returned from Italy he settled once more in Weimar. He visited Italy a second time. He became great friends with the famous poet and playwright Friedrich Schiller. The two men talked about many of their ideas and helped one another by offering criticism of their works. He wrote short works such as Hermann und Dorothea which is about life in a small German town at the time of the French Revolution.\u000aTwo works of the greatest importance works occupied him at this time. One is the novel Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre. This is an example of what is called in German a \u201cBildungsroman\u201d which means something like \u201cEducation novel\u201d. It means a novel which shows a person growing up and developing his character and learning about the world. This book was a very important influence on the 19th century Romantic novel and on all German autobiographical novels ever since. Goethe spent many years working on this book.\u000aThe second work of enormous importance was his play Faust. He made changes to the original version, putting all the small bits together into one great play. Schiller gave him advice while he was writing it. Faust enters into a pact with the devil, Mephistopheles who promises him all his soul can wish for: fine living, gold, women and honour. He signs the pact with his blood.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Later life (1805-1832) ==\u000aNapoleon was fighting wars all over Europe at this time. Germany, which was still made up of lots of small countries, was an enemy of France. Goethe always thought of Napoleon as a hero. His ideas about politics were still based on 18th century ideas. He hated war and so he did not take part in politics but concentrated on science and literature. He wrote a book called Die Wahlverwandtschaften (Elective Affinities) which is about a divorce problem. Some of his scientific ideas are used in the story as he talks about the way that two chemical compounds can break up and form new unions. He compares this to the people in his story. His poems in Westöstlicher Divan are some of his greatest. He uses ideas from Persia and other Eastern countries together with ideas from the West. It has a lot of parables about human life.\u000aMany interesting things that Goethe said were written down in a book by his friend Eckermann, who published them in a book called Conversations with Goethe. Goethe also wrote about his own life in his autobiography which he called Dichtung und Wahrheit (Poetry and Truth). The book tells us about his youth up to the time of his arrival in Weimar. It is in four parts. The fourth part was published after his death. He chose the title to show that he was telling us the truth about his life, but that he had changed the order of some events to make it into a poetic book.\u000aGoethe wrote a sequel (a part which follows on) to Wilhelm Meister called Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre (The Years of Wilhelm Meister\u2019s Wanderings). It consists of several sections which are like separate stories. They tell us about Wilhelm Meister\u2019s relationship with society and how he has to change his ways to fit in with other people.\u000aGoethe\u2019s Faust had made him the greatest person in European literature. At the end of his life he finished a second part of Faust. It is quite hard to read, and is more of a long poem than a dramatic play. It talks of his ideas about allegory, science and philosophy.\u000aGoethe died in Weimar on March 22, 1832. He had started as a great Classical writer of the 18th century and finished as a young Romantic of the 19th century. No one else had such a big influence on art and literature of that time.\u000a\u000a\u000a== His most important works ==\u000aGötz von Berlichingen mit der eisernen Hand, 1773\u000aPrometheus, 1774\u000aDie Leiden des jungen Werthers, 1774\u000aIphigenie auf Tauris, 1779\u000aTorquato Tasso, 1780 - 1790\u000aRömische Elegien, 1788-90\u000aVenezianische Epigramme, 1790\u000aFaust.

a(VThe domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris, previously Canis familiaris) is a member of the Canidae family of the mammalian order Carnivora. The term "domestic dog" is generally used for both domesticated and feral varieties. The dog was the first domesticated animal and has been the most widely kept working, hunting, and pet animal in human history. The word "dog" can also refer to the male of a canine species, as opposed to the word "bitch" which refers to the female of the species.\u000aRecent studies of "well-preserved remains of a dog-like canid from the Razboinichya Cave" in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia concluded that a particular instance of early wolf domestication approximately 33,000 years ago did not result in modern dog lineages, possibly because of climate disruption during the Last Glacial Maximum. The authors postulate that at least several such incipient events have occurred. A study of fossil dogs and wolves in Belgium, Ukraine, and Russia tentatively dates domestication from 14,000 years ago to more than 31,700 years ago. Another recent study has found support for claims of dog domestication between 14,000 and 16,000 years ago, with a range between 9,000 and 34,000 years ago, depending on mutation rate assumptions. Dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals. This impact on human society has given them the nickname "man's best friend" in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are also a source of meat. In 2001, there were estimated to be 400 million dogs in the world.\u000aMost breeds of dog are at most a few hundred years old, having been artificially selected for particular morphologies and behaviors by people for specific functional roles. Through this selective breeding, the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal. For example, height measured to the withers ranges from 15.2 centimetres (6.0 in) in the Chihuahua to about 76 cm (30 in) in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called "blue") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark ("red" or "chocolate") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth. It is common for most breeds to shed this coat.

a(VThe dog (Canis lupus familiaris) is a mammal from the family Canidae. It has been domesticated by humans for a long time. It was the first animal ever to be domesticated. Dogs are used by humans for many different things, for work and as pets. They are a popular pet because they are usually playful, friendly, and listen to humans. Thirty million dogs in the United States are registered as pets. Dogs eat both meat and vegetables, often mixed together and sold in stores as dog food. Dogs often have jobs, including as police dogs, army dogs, seeing eye dogs, fire dogs, messenger dogs, hunting dogs and sheepdogs.\u000aThey are sometimes called "canines" from the Latin word for dog - canis. Sometimes people also use "dog" to describe other canids, such as wolves. A baby dog is called a pup or puppy. A dog is called a puppy until it is about one year old.\u000aDogs are sometimes referred to as "man's best friend" because they are kept as domestic pets and are usually loyal and like being around humans.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Appearance and behaviour ==\u000aDogs can smell and hear very well, but cannot see well in color, or they are color blind. Dogs have four legs and make a "bark," "woof," or "arf" sound. Dogs often chase cats, and most dogs will fetch a ball or stick.\u000aDogs usually live about 10 years or more. The size and the breed of the dog may change how long the dog lives. Smaller dog breeds usually live longer.\u000aLike wolves, wild dogs travel in groups called packs. Packs of dogs are ordered by rank, and dogs with low rank will submit to other dogs with higher rank. The highest ranked dog is called the alpha male. A dog in a group helps and cares for others. Domesticated dogs often view their owner as the alpha male.[source?]\u000a\u000a\u000a== Origin of dogs ==\u000aAll dogs are descended from wolves,which of the wolves come from are the dire wolves. They're wolves, but dire. Which has happened due to domestication and artificial selection. This is known because DNA genome analysis has been done to discover this. They have been bred by humans. The earliest known fossil of a domestic dog is from 31,700 years ago in Belgium.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Dogs and humans ==\u000aDogs have lived with people for at least 30,000 years.[source?] They are often called "man's best friend" because they fit in with human life. Dogs can serve people in many ways. For example, there are guard dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, and guide dogs for blind people. There are also dogs that are trained to smell for diseases in the human body or to find bombs or illegal drugs. These dogs sometimes help police in airports or other areas. Sniffer dogs (usually beagles) are sometimes trained for this job. Dogs have even been sent by Russians into outer space, a few years before any human being. The first dog sent up was called Laika, but died while there.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Dog breeds ==\u000a\u000aSee also List of dog breeds.\u000aThere are at least 800 breeds (kinds) of dogs. Dogs whose parents were the same breed will also be that breed: these dogs are called purebred or pure pedigree dogs. Dogs with parents from different breeds no longer belong to one breed: they are called mutts, mixed-breed dogs, hybrids, or mongrels. Some of the most popular breeds are sheepdogs, collies, poodles and retrievers. It is becoming popular to breed together two different breeds of dogs and call the new dog's breed a name that is a mixture of the parents' breeds' two names. A puppy with a poodle and a pomeranian as parents might be called a Pomapoo. These kinds of dogs, instead of being called mutts, are known as designer dog breeds. These dogs are normally used for prize shows and designer shows. They can be guide dogs.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Photogallery ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Related pages ==\u000aThe Puppy Bowl\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

a(VA meme (/\u02c8mi\u02d0m/ meem) is "an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture." A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.\u000aThe word meme is a shortening (modeled on gene) of mimeme (from Ancient Greek \u03bc\u03af\u03bc\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 Greek pronunciation: [mí\u02d0m\u025b\u02d0ma] m\u012bm\u0113ma, "imitated thing", from \u03bc\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 mimeisthai, "to imitate", from \u03bc\u1fd6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 mimos "mime") and it was coined by the British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene (1976) as a concept for discussion of evolutionary principles in explaining the spread of ideas and cultural phenomena. Examples of memes given in the book included melodies, catch-phrases, fashion, and the technology of building arches.\u000aProponents theorize that memes may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of biological evolution. Memes do this through the processes of variation, mutation, competition, and inheritance, each of which influence a meme's reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they generate in their hosts. Memes that propagate less prolifically may become extinct, while others may survive, spread, and (for better or for worse) mutate. Memes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their hosts.\u000aA field of study called memetics arose in the 1990s to explore the concepts and transmission of memes in terms of an evolutionary model. Criticism from a variety of fronts has challenged the notion that academic study can examine memes empirically. However, developments in neuroimaging may make empirical study possible. Some commentators in the social sciences question the idea that one can meaningfully categorize culture in terms of discrete units, and are especially critical of the biological nature of the theory's underpinnings. Others have argued that this use of the term is the result of a misunderstanding of the original proposal.\u000aDawkins' own position is somewhat ambiguous: he obviously welcomed N. K. Humphrey's suggestion that "memes should be considered as living structures, not just metaphorically" and wanted to regard memes as "physically residing in the brain". Later, he argued that his original intentions, presumably before his approval of Humphrey's opinion, had been simpler. At the New Directors' Showcase 2013 in Cannes, Dawkins' opinion on memetics was deliberately ambiguous.\u000a\u000a

a(VA meme (pronunciation:mi\u02d0m) is a way of describing cultural information.\u000aOne theory is that culture develops in the same way similar to living things. Genes move from one organism to another as a unit of genetic information and of biological evolution. A meme moves from person to person and changes and develops as many people use it.\u000aBiologist and evolutionary theorist Richard Dawkins made the word meme in 1976. He said that tunes, catch-phrases, beliefs, clothing fashions, ways of making pots, and the technology of building arches were all examples of memes.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Examples of memes ==\u000aTechnology: cars, paper-clips, etc. The progress of technology is clearly like the progress of genetics, because it also has to spread and go through mutations or changes to progress. For example, many paper-clip designs have been made. Some last longer than others, and some look better than others. In the end the ones that are copied are a memetic success.\u000aJokes spread and change the more they are told.\u000aProverbs\u000aGossip\u000aNursery rhymes: passed on from parent to child over many generations (thus keeping old words such as "tuffet" and "chamber" popular when they are not used today).\u000aEpic poems: once important memes for preserving oral history; writing has largely superseded their oral transmission.\u000aConspiracy theories\u000aRecipes\u000aFashions\u000aReligions: complex memes, including folk religious beliefs, such as The Prayer of Jabez.\u000aPopular concepts: these include Freedom, Justice, Ownership, Open Source, Egoism, or Altruism\u000aGroup-based biases: everything from anti-semitism and racism to cargo cults.\u000aLongstanding political memes such as "mob rule", national identity, Yes Minister and "republic, not a democracy".\u000aProgramming paradigms: from structured programming and object-oriented programming to extreme programming.\u000aInternet phenomena: Internet slang. "Internet memes" propagate quickly among users using email, websites, blogs, discussion boards and other Internet communications as a medium.\u000aMoore's Law: this meme has a particularly interesting form of self-replication. The conviction that "semiconductor complexity doubles every 18 months" became considerably more than a predictive observation; it became a performance-target for an entire industry once that industry extensively started to believe in the "law". Manufacturers now strive to make the next generation of semiconductor technology re-create the growth in performance of the previous generation, and so maintain belief in Moore's Law. Additionally, the evolution of this meme provides details of interest. The original law described growth in terms of the number of transistors on a chip, but people - more and more\u2014have (wrongly) understood it as describing an increase in terms of performance. This could exemplify how a meme can mutate slowly under the pressure of its environment (partial technical understanding and simplification for use in the mainstream media).\u000aMetameme: The concept of memes itself is a meme.\u000aAnecdotes: Short jokes or other stories.\u000aPhrases; an expression, like "Whasssssup!" or "Where's the beef?" or the Internet meme "all your base are belong to us!"\u000aViral marketing: A type of marketing based on memes and using "word of mouth" to advertise (see the recent example of Snakes on a Plane).\u000aChain-letters\u000a\u000a\u000a== Related pages ==\u000aFigure of speech\u000aInternet meme\u000aPropaganda\u000aRhetoric\u000aSelf-replication\u000aSemiotics\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Literature ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other websites ==\u000aThe Meme Machine, Interview of Susan Blackmore by Denis Failly\u000aJournal of Memetics\u000aThe text of Dawkins' Selfish Gene, chapter 11, "Memes: the new replicators", in which Dawkins coined the word "meme"\u000aThe Mocking Memes: A Basis for Automated Intelligence, a 2006 book on a memetic theory of mind.\u000aCultural Software: A Theory of Ideology by Jack Balkin which uses memes to explain the growth and spread of ideology.\u000aWhy did the chicken cross the road?

a(VThe spleen (from Greek \u03c3\u03c0\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u2014spl\u1e17n) is an organ found in virtually all vertebrates. Similar in structure to a large lymph node, it acts primarily as a blood filter. It is possible to remove the spleen without jeopardizing life. The spleen plays important roles in regard to red blood cells (also referred to as erythrocytes) and the immune system. It removes old red blood cells and holds a reserve of blood, which can be valuable in case of hemorrhagic shock, and also recycles iron. As a part of the mononuclear phagocyte system, it metabolizes hemoglobin removed from senescent erythrocytes. The globin portion of hemoglobin is degraded to its constitutive amino acids, and the heme portion is metabolized to bilirubin, which is removed in the liver.\u000aThe spleen synthesizes antibodies in its white pulp and removes antibody-coated bacteria and antibody-coated blood cells by way of blood and lymph node circulation. A study published in 2009 using mice found that the spleen contains, in its reserve, half of the body's monocytes within the red pulp. These monocytes, upon moving to injured tissue (such as the heart), turn into dendritic cells and macrophages while promoting tissue healing. The spleen is a center of activity of the mononuclear phagocyte system and can be considered analogous to a large lymph node, as its absence causes a predisposition to certain infections.\u000aIn humans, the spleen is brownish in color and is located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.

a(VThe spleen is a gland (a special organ) in the body. It works closely with the circulatory system (the system which brings blood to the body).\u000aUntil recently, scientists did not know why the spleen was important. Now, scientists are realizing that without a spleen, a person is more likely to get certain infections. The spleen makes, keeps an eye on, destroys, and stores red blood cells. The spleen also makes red and white pulp. The red pulp takes unwanted things out of the bloodstream. The white pulp helps fight infections. Still, a person does not need a spleen to survive.\u000aThe spleen is shaped like a loose fist. It is tucked under the left side of the diaphragm.\u000aThe average adult spleen weighs 0.44 lbs. The spleen gets bigger while a person is digesting food, and afterwards. The spleen can also get bigger if a person is infected with malaria or mononucleosis ("mono").\u000aIf a person's spleen gets big enough, it can rupture (break). If this happens, the person needs medical care right away. He might need emergency surgery to control bleeding.\u000aThe spleen can also get bigger because of other diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, sickle cell anemia, leukemia, and lymphoma.

a(VMorphine (INN) (/\u02c8m\u0254rfi\u02d0n/) (sold under nearly a hundred trade names) is an opioid analgesic drug, a recreational drug, and the main psychoactive chemical in opium. In clinical medicine, morphine is regarded as the gold standard, or benchmark, of analgesics used to relieve intense pain and suffering. Like other opioids, such as oxycodone, hydromorphone, and diacetylmorphine (heroin), morphine acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.\u000aMorphine has a high potential for addiction; tolerance and psychological dependence develop rapidly, although physiological dependence may take several months to develop. Tolerance to respiratory depression and euphoria develops more rapidly than tolerance to analgesia, and many chronic pain patients are therefore maintained on a stable dose for years. However, its effects can also reverse fairly rapidly, worsening pain through hyperalgesia.\u000aMorphine is the most abundant opiate found in opium, the dried latex from unripe seedpods of Papaver somniferum (the opium poppy). Morphine was the first active ingredient purified from a plant source. It is one of at least fifty alkaloids of several different types present in opium, poppy straw concentrate, and other poppy derivatives. The primary source of morphine is chemical extraction from opium.\u000aMorphine was first isolated in 1804 by Friedrich Sertürner, which is generally believed to be the first ever isolation of a natural plant alkaloid in history. Sertürner began distributing it in 1817, and Merck began marketing it commercially in 1827. At the time, Merck was a single small chemists' shop. Morphine was more widely used after the invention of the hypodermic needle in 1857. Sertürner originally named the substance morphium after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus (Greek: \u039c\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2), for its tendency to cause sleep. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system.

a(VMorphine (INN) (IPA: [\u02c8m\u0254(\u0279)fin]) is a strong opiate pain killer drug. It is the principal active agent in opium and the prototypical opiate. Like other opioids, e.g. diacetylmorphine (heroin), morphine acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain, and at synapses of the nucleus accumbens in particular. Morphine is highly addictive when compared to other substances, and tolerance and physical and mental dependences develop very rapidly.\u000aPatients on morphine sometimes say they have insomnia, visual hallucinations and nightmares; if these occur then reduction in dosage or switch to an alternative opioid analgesic should be considered.\u000aThe word "morphine" is derived from Morpheus, the god of dreams in Greek mythology. He is the son of Hypnos, god of sleep.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Medical uses ==\u000aMorphine is used legally:\u000aAs a pain killer in hospital settings for\u000atreating pain after surgery\u000arelieving pain associated with trauma\u000a\u000aIn the relief of severe chronic pain, e.g.\u000aCancer pain\u000aPain from kidney stones\u000aBack pain\u000a\u000aAs an adjunct to general pain killers\u000aIn epidural anesthesia or intrathecal analgesia\u000aFor palliative care (i.e. to lessen pain without curing the underlying reason for it.

Originally called the Magic Cube, the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Ideal Toy Corp. in 1980 via German businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer, and won the German Game of the Year special award for Best Puzzle that year. As of January 2009, 350 million cubes had been sold worldwide making it the world's top-selling puzzle game. It is widely considered to be the world's best-selling toy.\u000aIn a classic Rubik's Cube, each of the six faces is covered by nine stickers, each of one of six solid colours: white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow. In currently sold models, white is opposite yellow, blue is opposite green, and orange is opposite red, and the red, white and blue are arranged in that order in a clockwise arrangement. On early cubes, the position of the colours varied from cube to cube. An internal pivot mechanism enables each face to turn independently, thus mixing up the colours. For the puzzle to be solved, each face must be returned to consisting of one colour. Similar puzzles have now been produced with various numbers of sides, dimensions, and stickers, not all of them by Rubik.\u000aAlthough the Rubik's Cube reached its height of mainstream popularity in the 1980s, it is still widely known and used. Many speedcubers continue to practice it and other twisty puzzles and compete for the fastest times in various categories.

Foods commonly used for the base in a soufflé include cheese, jam, fruits, berries, chocolate, banana and lemon (the last three are used for desserts, often with a large amount of sugar).\u000aWhen it comes out of the oven, a soufflé should be puffed up and fluffy, and it will generally fall after 5 or 10 minutes (as risen dough does).\u000aMany choose to puncture the top of the souffle, and pour various types of liquid sauces (ex. chocolate, vanilla).\u000aSoufflés can be made in containers of all shapes and sizes but it is traditional to make soufflé in ramekins. These containers vary greatly in size, but are typically glazed white, flat-bottomed, round porcelain containers with unglazed bottoms and fluted exterior borders.\u000aThere are a number of variations on the soufflé theme. One is an ice cream soufflé, which combines a soufflé with ice cream and either a fruit or a hot sauce.\u000aAnother kind of dish entirely is soufflé potatoes, which are puffed-up sautéed potato slices, traditionally served with a chateaubriand steak.\u000a\u000a

a(VChlorine is a chemical element with symbol Cl and atomic number 17. Chlorine is in the halogen group (17) and is the second lightest halogen following fluorine. The element is a yellow-green gas under standard conditions, where it forms diatomic molecules. Chlorine has the highest electron affinity and the fourth highest electronegativity of all the reactive elements. For this reason, chlorine is a strong oxidizing agent. Free chlorine is rare on Earth, and is usually a result of direct or indirect oxidation by oxygen.\u000aThe most common compound of chlorine, sodium chloride (common salt), has been known since ancient times. Around 1630 chlorine gas was first synthesized in a chemical reaction, but not recognized as a fundamentally important substance. Characterization of chlorine gas was made in 1774 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, who supposed it to be an oxide of a new element. In 1809 chemists suggested that the gas might be a pure element, and this was confirmed by Sir Humphry Davy in 1810, who named it from Ancient Greek: \u03c7\u03bb\u03c9\u03c1ó\u03c2 khlôros \u201cpale green\u201d.\u000aNearly all chlorine in the Earth's crust occurs as chloride in various ionic compounds, including table salt. It is the second most abundant halogen and 21st most abundant chemical element in Earth's crust. Elemental chlorine is commercially produced from brine by electrolysis. The high oxidizing potential of elemental chlorine led commercially to free chlorine's bleaching and disinfectant uses, as well as its many uses of an essential reagent in the chemical industry. Chlorine is used in the manufacture of a wide range of consumer products, about two-thirds of them organic chemicals such as polyvinyl chloride, as well as many intermediates for production of plastics and other end products which do not contain the element. As a common disinfectant, elemental chlorine and chlorine-generating compounds are used more directly in swimming pools to keep them clean and sanitary.\u000aIn the form of chloride ions, chlorine is necessary to all known species of life. Other types of chlorine compounds are rare in living organisms, and artificially produced chlorinated organics range from inert to toxic. In the upper atmosphere, chlorine-containing organic molecules such as chlorofluorocarbons have been implicated in ozone depletion. Small quantities of elemental chlorine are generated by oxidation of chloride to hypochlorite in neutrophils, as part of the immune response against bacteria. Elemental chlorine at high concentrations is extremely dangerous and poisonous for all living organisms, and was used in World War I as the first gaseous chemical warfare agent.

It has a strong smell like bleach. It is toxic. It can be made into a liquid when cooled. It is heavier than air.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Chemical properties ===\u000aChlorine is highly reactive. It is more reactive than bromine but less reactive than fluorine. It reacts with most things to make chlorides. It can even burn things instead of oxygen. It dissolves in water to make a mixture of hypochlorous acid and hydrochloric acid. The more acidic it is, the more chlorine is made; the more basic it is, the more hypochlorous acid (normally turned into hypochlorite) and hydrochloric acid (normally turned into chlorides) are there. Chlorine reacts with bromides and iodides to make bromine and iodine.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Chlorine compounds ===\u000a\u000aChlorine exists in several oxidation states: -1, +1, +3, +4, +5, and +7. The -1 state is most often in chloride. Chlorides are not reactive. Compounds containing chlorine in its +1 oxidation state are hypochlorites. Only one is common. They are a strong oxidizing agent, as are all + oxidation state compounds. +3 is in chlorites. +4 is in chlorine dioxide, a common chlorine compound that is not a chloride. +5 is in chlorates. +7 is in perchlorates. Hypochlorites are most reactive, while perchlorates are the least reactive.\u000aMany organic compounds have chlorine in them. Freon has chlorine in it. PVC (Poly-vinyl chloride), a common plastic, has chlorine in it.\u000aChlorine oxides can be made, but most of them are very reactive and unstable.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Occurrence ==\u000aChlorine is not found as an element. Sodium chloride is the most common chlorine ore. It is in the ocean (sea salt) and in the ground (rock salt). There are some organic compounds that have chlorine in them, too.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Preparation ==\u000aIt is made by electrolysis (the passing of electricity through a solution to make chemical reactions happen) of sodium chloride. This is known as the chloralkali process. It can also be made by reacting hydrogen chloride with oxygen and a catalyst. It can be made in the laboratory by reacting manganese dioxide with hydrochloric acid. It is made when sodium hypochlorite reacts with hydrochloric acid. This is a dangerous reaction that can happen without anyone knowing.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Uses ==\u000aChlorine is used widely to purify water (usually in a swimming pool), as a disinfectant and bleach, and in the making of many important compounds including chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. It was used as a poison gas in some wars.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000aIt was discovered in 1774 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele who thought it had oxygen in it.

a(VAn earthworm is a tube-shaped, segmented animal commonly found living in soil, that feeds on live and dead organic matter. Its digestive system runs through the length of its body. It conducts respiration through its skin. An earthworm has a double transport system composed of coelomic fluid that moves within the fluid-filled coelom and a simple, closed blood circulatory system. It has a central and a peripheral nervous system. The central nervous system consists of two ganglia above the mouth, one on either side, connected to a nerve cord running back along its length to motor neurons and sensory cells in each segment. Large numbers of chemoreceptors are concentrated near its mouth. Circumferential and longitudinal muscles on the periphery of each segment enable the worm to move. Similar sets of muscles line the gut, and their actions move the digesting food toward the worm's anus.\u000aEarthworms are hermaphrodites\u2014each individual carries both male and female sex organs. As an invertebrate, it lacks a skeleton, but it maintains its structure with fluid-filled coelom chambers that function as a hydrostatic skeleton.\u000a"Earthworm" is the common name for the largest members of Oligochaeta (which is either a class or a subclass depending on the author) in the phylum Annelida. In classical systems, they were placed in the order Opisthopora, on the basis of the male pores opening posterior to the female pores, though the internal male segments are anterior to the female. Theoretical cladistic studies have placed them, instead, in the suborder Lumbricina of the order Haplotaxida, but this may again soon change. Folk names for the earthworm include "dew-worm", "rainworm", "night crawler", and "angleworm" (due to its use as fishing bait).\u000aLarger terrestrial earthworms are also called megadriles (or big worms), as opposed to the microdriles (or small worms) in the semiaquatic families Tubificidae, Lumbriculidae, and Enchytraeidae, among others. The megadriles are characterized by having a distinct clitellum (which is more extensive than that of microdriles) and a vascular system with true capillaries.\u000aEarthworms are far less abundant in disturbed environments and are typically active only if water is present.

a(VFor the storage device, see Write Once Read Many\u000a\u000aAn earthworm is an invertebrate animal with a long body and no legs. It is a type of annelid.\u000aThere are over 5,500 known species of worms. They can be found everywhere, except in polar or dry climates. Their size varies: they can be between two centimeters and about three metres in length. The biggest known earthworm is the Giant Gippsland Earthworm, one of about 1 000 earthworm species found in Australia. They are usually about 80cm in length, but can grow to about 3 metres. Some other worms are Tapeworm and roundworm. Both of those worms are parasites.\u000aThe most common earthworm (in Europe, and most other temperate climate regions) can grow to a size of about 20-25 cm when extended.\u000aMost earthworms can regrow lost segments. This capability varies by species though.\u000aLong ago, all animals looking like worms were lumped together by John Ray, and by Linnaeus in their classifications. Later, biologists found that some were in quite different groups. Roundworms and flatworms are different phyla. Inchworms are a type of caterpillar, and the slow-worm is a legless lizard.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Physical characteristics of an earthworm ==\u000aAn earthworm has a pointy head and small mouth. The colour of an earthworm can be brown, pink or red. Earthworms have a long body. They look squishy and gushy and slimy, but they are not. They have tiny hairs called bristles. Earthworms have ringed segments. They have a saddle where it lays its eggs. Earthworms have five pairs of hearts. It has no thorax or abdomen.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Earthworm habitats ==\u000aEarthworms live in dark damp soil. They live in vegetable peels. They also live in meadows and dead plants. Earthworms live in gardens. They live under rocks. Earthworms live in wet woods. They also live in damp grass.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reproduction ==\u000aDespite the fact that worms are both male and female they still need a partner to reproduce. They will find another worm and transfer sperm to the egg by wriggling against each other till the spot where the egg is and the sperm is, thus fertilizing the egg. The egg is then laid. When the egg hatches the worms inside will come out and grow until they can mate which takes about 6 weeks.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Diet ==\u000aEarthworms eat soil and rocks. The rocks they eat are tiny and earthworms crush and grind them with their guts. They eat oatmeal. Earthworms eat roots. Earthworms eat compost and also dead plants. An earthworm has enemies like hedgehogs, birds(such as cardinals), and snakes. Their defenses are camouflaging. Camouflage means you cannot see it because it is the same colour (or shade) as its background.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aLlewellyn, Clair 2000. Earthworms.

a(VBallet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Ballet requires years of training to learn and master, and much practice to retain proficiency. It has been taught in ballet schools around the world, which have historically used their own cultures to evolve the art.\u000aBallet may also refer to a ballet dance work, which consists of the choreography and music for a ballet production. A well-known example of this is The Nutcracker, a two-act ballet that was originally choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov with a music score by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Ballet dance works are choreographed and performed by trained artists. Many classical ballet works are performed with classical music accompaniment and are theatrical and use elaborate costumes and staging, though there are exceptions to this, such as works by George Balanchine.\u000a\u000a

a(VBallet is a type of dance. It is only done by dancers who have had special training. The dancers are employed by a dance company, and they perform in theatres. The first reference to ballet is found in a work of Domenico da Piacenza, who lived in the early 14th century.\u000aBallet involves the creation of the dance itself, often a type of imaginary story. The story is told with the help of dance and mime. The creation of dance is called choreography. The choreography is learnt by the dancers under the supervision of a trainer, called a ballet master or mistress. Ballet is always performed to music, and in many cases the music was specially composed for a particular ballet. Ballet is a major part of theatre, and a popular example is The Nutcracker.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Early stages ===\u000aBallet grew out of Renaissance spectacles which, rather like big pop music events today, used every type of performance art. These Italian ballets were further developed in France. Le Ballet Comique de la Reine (The Queen's Ballet Comedy) was performed in Paris in 1581. It was staged by Balthazar de Beaujoyeux, a violinist and dancing master at the court of Catherine de Medici. It was danced by amateurs in a hall. The royal family were watching at one end and the others in galleries on three sides. Poetry and songs came with the dances.\u000aThe basis of classical ballet was formed in the Court of Louis XIV in France, in the 17th century.p40 Even his title (the 'Sun King') came from a role he danced in a ballet. Louis founded the first ballet company, the Ballet de l'Opera de Paris. Many of the ballets presented at his court were created by the composer Jean-Baptiste Lully and the choreographer Pierre Beauchamp. Also during this time, the playwright Molière invented the comedie-ballet.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Modern technique begins ===\u000aIn the early 19th century ballet technique was codified (sorted out and written down) by Carlo Blasis (1797\u20131878) of Naples. His dance classes, four hours long, were famous for being the toughest training there was at that time. 'Romantic ballet' flourished in France in the first half of the 19th century.\u000aBallet with a more athletic style was developed in Imperial Russia of the late 19th century. This company performed in the Mariinsky Theatre at St. Petersburg. The three famous Tchaikovsky ballets, Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty, and The Nutcracker, date from that time. The next stage was the Diaghilev ballet. Diageilev was a great impresario (showman). In 1909 he founded Les Ballets Russes de Sergei Diaghilev, considered by many to be the greatest ballet company of all time.\u000a"Its success was so extraordinary, its ballets so revolutionary, and its artists so electrifying that its appearance in Paris before the First World War sparked an international ballet boom".p47\u000aHis dancers included the legendary Nijinsky and the Imperial primaballerina Karsavina; also Pavlova, Danilova and Spessivtseva. His choreographers included Fokine, Massine and Balanchine; his composers included Stravinsky, Prokofiev, Ravel and Debussy; his set designers included Picasso, Cezanne, Matisse, Utrillo, Bakst and Braque; and the ballets created changed the course of ballet history.\u000aLater in the 20th century, permanent ballet companies were set up in English-speaking countries. The Royal Ballet in London was started, and in New York a company called the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo was founded (1938\u20131962).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Technique ==\u000aTechnique is the physical ability to perform whatever steps a dance may need. Specific methods for refining technique are named after the ballet master or mistress who started them, such as the Vaganova method after Agrippina Vaganova, the Balanchine method after George Balanchine, and the Cecchetti method after Enrico Cecchetti.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other websites ==\u000aBeginner's Guide to Ballet\u000aBallet Videos\u000aAndros on Ballet\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

a(VUltrasound is an oscillating sound pressure wave with a frequency greater than the upper limit of the human hearing range. Ultrasound is thus not separated from 'normal' (audible) sound by differences in physical properties, only by the fact that humans cannot hear it. Although this limit varies from person to person, it is approximately 20 kilohertz (20,000 hertz) in healthy, young adults. Ultrasound devices operate with frequencies from 20 kHz up to several gigahertz.\u000aUltrasound is used in many different fields. Ultrasonic devices are used to detect objects and measure distances. Ultrasonic imaging (sonography) is used in both veterinary medicine and human medicine. In the nondestructive testing of products and structures, ultrasound is used to detect invisible flaws. Industrially, ultrasound is used for cleaning and for mixing, and to accelerate chemical processes. Animals such as bats and porpoises use ultrasound for locating prey and obstacles.\u000a\u000aUltrasonics is the application of ultrasound. Ultrasound can be used for medical imaging, detection, measurement and cleaning. At higher power levels, ultrasonics is useful for changing the chemical properties of substances.

a(VUltrasound is a type of sound with a frequency bigger than humans can hear. This frequency, the 'upper-limit of human hearing,' is approximately 20,000 hertz (20 kilohertz).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Ability to hear ultrasound ==\u000aSome animals, such as dogs, dolphins, bats, and mice, are able to hear sounds which have a frequency greater than upper-limit of the human ear. This makes them able to hear ultrasounds. Children can hear some high-pitched sounds that older adults cannot hear, as in humans the upper limit pitch of hearing gets lower as a person gets older. This frequency limit is caused by the middle ear that acts as a low-pass filter. If ultrasound is fed directly into the skull bone and reaches the cochlea without passing through the middle ear, much higher frequencies (up to about 200 kHz) can be heard. This effect (sometimes called ultrasonic hearing) was first discovered by divers exposed to a high-frequency (ca. 50 kHz) sonar signal.\u000aObstetric sonography is commonly used during pregnancy. Ultrasound is generally thought of as a "safe test" because it does not use ionising (destructive) radiation like x-rays, nuclear medicine, or CT scans.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Ultrasonic cleaning ==\u000aUltrasonic cleaners are sometimes mistakenly called supersonic cleaners. They are used at frequencies from 20-40 kHz for jewellery, lenses and other optical parts, watches, dental instruments, surgical instruments and industrial parts. An ultrasonic cleaner works by the energy released from the collapse of millions of tiny (microscopic) 'cavitations's near the dirty surface. The bubbles formed by cavitation collapse forming small jets directed at the surface.

a(VBruce Lee (Chinese: \u674e\u5c0f\u9f8d; born Lee Jun-fan, Chinese: \u674e\u632f\u85e9; 27 November 1940 \u2013 20 July 1973) was a Hong Kong American martial artist, Hong Kong action film actor, martial arts instructor, filmmaker, and the founder of Jeet Kune Do. Lee was the son of Cantonese opera star Lee Hoi-Chuen. He is widely considered by commentators, critics, media and other martial artists to be one of the most influential martial artists of all time, and a pop culture icon of the 20th century. He is often credited with helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films.\u000aLee was born in Chinatown, San Francisco on 27 November 1940 to parents from Hong Kong and was raised in Kowloon with his family until his late teens. He was introduced to the film industry by his father and appeared in several films as a child actor. Lee moved to the United States at the age of 18 to receive his higher education, at the University of Washington, and it was during this time that he began teaching martial arts. His Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the traditional Hong Kong martial arts film to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of interest in Chinese martial arts in the West in the 1970s. The direction and tone of his films changed and influenced martial arts and martial arts films in Hong Kong and the rest of the world.\u000aHe is noted for his roles in five feature-length films: Lo Wei's The Big Boss (1971) and Fist of Fury (1972); Way of the Dragon (1972), directed and written by Lee; Warner Brothers' Enter the Dragon (1973) and The Game of Death (1973), both directed by Robert Clouse. Lee became an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the Chinese, as he portrayed Chinese nationalism in his films. He initially trained in Wing Chun and Boxing, but later rejected well-defined martial art styles, favouring instead the use of techniques from various sources, in the spirit of his personal martial arts philosophy, which he dubbed Jeet Kune Do (The Way of the Intercepting Fist). Lee held dual nationality of Hong Kong and the United States. He died in Kowloon Tong on 20 July 1973 at the age of 32.

a(VBruce Lee (November 27, 1940 - July 20, 1973) was a Chinese-American, Hong Kong actor, martial artist, martial arts instructor, philosopher, movie director, movie producer, screenwriter, and founder of the Jeet Kune Do martial arts movement. He is most famous for making martial arts popular in the United States in the 1970s, when he played in a series of movies, including the first ever martial arts movie in the United States - called Enter the Dragon, which were all very successful all over the world. 'Enter The Dragon' was the most successful and famous, which was released after Bruce's death. He died in 1973 during the production of a movie called, 'Game of Death', during the height of his popularity, but was unable to finish it (almost 20 years later his son, Brandon Lee would die while filming a movie). Lee also taught other people martial arts, like actors Huggo Chairres, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, and Basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, he also inspired many other actors who are famous for using martial arts in their movies including Jackie Chan, Jet Li, and Chuck Norris. Jackie Chan had a bit-part in 'Enter The Dragon' and Chuck Norris co-starred in Way of The Dragon. Bruce starred in 5 movies, including The Big Boss, Fist of Fury (also known as The Chinese Connection and The Iron Hand), The Way of the Dragon (also known as Return of the Dragon), Enter the Dragon and Game of Death. He was never able to finish Game of Death due to his death, but completed parts of it were released. Enter the Dragon was his final full completed movie and was also his first Hollywood mainstream American movie.\u000aHe is noted for his major contributions to both the Hong Kong and American movie industry during the 1970's, his martial arts movement and innovative ideas (including Jeet Kune Do), his philosophy, and his physical fitness ability. He is considered to be a cultural icon and is considered to be one of the most influential martial artists ever by social critics and other martial artists alike.\u000aOn the night of July 20, 1973, Lee died at 32 of compilations at his home.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other websites ==\u000aBruce Lee at the Internet Movie Database\u000aBruce Lee Foundation\u000aBruce Lee talk\u000aSketchu: Drawn portrait of Bruce Lee\u000aCircle of Iron: Bruce Lee's Lost Movie
